In this project, we wanted to train a model to determine whether a customer is going to purchace the product. At first, we cleaned and filled the unknown values with KNN method since replacing them with strategies such as most frequent, median, mean and... can imbalance our dataset
Then we selected the most relevant features and trained our 3 different models. The average accuracy on train and test set are 87.33% and 86.99% respectively.
The highets score was achieved by KNeighbors Classifier with 89.2% and 88.1% accuracy on train and test set
